# spicetify community themes

This is a collection of themes for [spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) **V3** (in beta), a command-line tool to customize Spotify.

You can add your own theme simply by opening a Pull Request (more info in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Installation and usage

Installation has not been set up yet, so you'll have to clone and follow the plugin enabling instructions for v3.

## Troubleshooting

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. If you find problems when using or installing these themes, or you need help in modifying a theme then ask for suggestions on the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/VnevqPp2Rr).

Use GitHub issues ONLY for bugs and requesting new features.

If you are unsure about which channel to use, go Discord.
